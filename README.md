# Wrap-a-map
> A Node app that abstracts popular mapping APIs into a single generic API service.

When using third party APIs in a large enterprise, it is nice to create wrappers for those APIs in case those third parties change. The third party change is invisable to your wrapper API consumers. This is an explortory project to see how this wrapper may look written in Node. 

## Development setup

Developed against Node 9.11.1

```sh
cd wrapamap
npm install
```
